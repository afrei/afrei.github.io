			<h1>Hi! I'm Adam Freilich.</h1>
			<p> I'm a student in my last semester at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>I'm currently writing a thesis about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morley's_categoricity_theorem">Morley's Categoricity Theorem</a>. You can view my progress <a href="https://github.com/afrei/thesis">here</a>.</p>

<p>I also do math problems <a href="https://github.com/afrei/mathwork/">here</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/afrei/LPL">This</a> is a Haskell project on worked on. It's a toy programming language implementing a linear type system based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_logic">linear logic</a>.</p>
