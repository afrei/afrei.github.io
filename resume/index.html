<h2>Education </h2>

<p> I recieved a <strong>BA and MA in Mathematics</strong>
  from the <strong><a href="#">University of Pennsylvania</a></strong> in December of 2014, where I minored in
  Computer Science and <a href="#">Logic, Information & Computation</a></p>

<ul>
 <li>In Summer of 2013 I did research with <a href="#">Dr. Rajeev Alur</a> (UofP). I met with him and a graduate student about once a week, doing independent work in between meetings. See Publications.</li>
 <li>In Fall of 2013 and Spring of 2014, I served as a teaching assistant for courses in
the theory of computation and algorithms respectively, where I graded homeworks and tests, held office hours and answered student questions online.</li>
 <li>In Fall of 2014 I co-facilitated the Penn Emerging Scholars Program, a program
for freshman interested in math and computer science aimed at students from
groups underrepresented in those fields. Each session I would give a short
presentation and discuss related problems with small groups of students.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm currently a <strong>PhD Student in Computer Science</strong> at
<strong><a href="#">Columbia University</a></strong>. I started in the Fall of 2015.
I'm working broadly in theory and focusing on learning theory and property testing.</p>

<ul>
 <li> I completed my course requirements. Some courses: <a href="#">Operating Systems</a>,
<a href="#">Computational Biology, </a>
<a href="#">Introduction to Cryptography, </a>
<a href="#">"Minimalist Cryptography".</a></li>
 <li>I served as teaching assistant for a course in
<a href="#">"Low Level Complexity"</a> which proves lower bounds against circuits and related computational models.</li>
 <li>I worked on a project about
<a href="#">testing high-dimensional convexity</a>.
We showed good upper and lower bounds for the problem.</li>
</ul>


  <h2>Software Experience</h2>

  <p>In Summer of 2014 I was a <strong>Software Engineering Intern Summer at Facebook</strong>
  at their Menlo Park campus in California with the release enginnering team for Creative Labs (Facebook's mobile delevopment)</p>
  <ul>
   <li>I worked independently to design and implement a coding utility to ensure
    Facebook code would comply with Apple's App Store policy.</li>
   <li>I integrated the analyzer into Facebook's code submission process.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Publications</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Xi Chen, <strong>Adam Freilich</strong>, Rocco Servedio and Timothy Sun.
    <a href="#">Sample-based high-dimensional convexity testing</a>.
