			<h1>About Adam Freilich</h1>
			<p>I'm a student at Penn persuing Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Math expecting to graduate in December of 2014. I'm also minoring in Computer Science and Logic, Information & Computation.</p>

<p> I'm particularly interested in Logic and how it relates to computation. I was particularly inspired by applications of finite model theory to complexity theory. I'm also interested in algorithms, algebra, category theory, machine learning, programming languages and topology.</p>

<p>I'm currently applying to Ph.D. programs (with the intent of starting in Fall 2015).</p>
